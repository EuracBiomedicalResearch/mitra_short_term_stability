# Short-term stability of Neoteryx Mitra blood microsamples

In this project the short-term stability of Neoteryx Mitra blood microsamples is
evaluated using an untargeted metabolomics setup for polar metabolites. The
impact of different storage conditions on metabolite concentrations is
investigated.
