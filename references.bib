abstract = {BACKGROUND:Success of metabolomics as the phenotyping platform largely depends on its ability to detect various sources of biological variability. Removal of platform-specific sources of variability such as systematic error is therefore one of the foremost priorities in data preprocessing. However, chemical diversity of molecular species included in typical metabolic profiling experiments leads to different responses to variations in experimental conditions, making normalization a very demanding task.

RESULTS:With the aim to remove unwanted systematic variation, we present an approach that utilizes variability information from multiple internal standard compounds to find optimal normalization factor for each individual molecular species detected by metabolomics approach (NOMIS). We demonstrate the method on mouse liver lipidomic profiles using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, and compare its performance to two commonly utilized normalization methods: normalization by l2 norm and by retention time region specific standard compound profiles. The NOMIS method proved superior in its ability to reduce the effect of systematic error across the full spectrum of metabolite peaks. We also demonstrate that the method can be used to select best combinations of standard compounds for normalization.

CONCLUSION:Depending on experiment design and biological matrix, the NOMIS method is applicable either as a one-step normalization method or as a two-step method where the normalization parameters, influenced by variabilities of internal standard compounds and their correlation to metabolites, are first calculated from a study conducted in repeatability conditions. The method can also be used in analytical development of metabolomics methods by helping to select best combinations of standard compounds for a particular biological matrix and analytical platform.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Simple random subsampling is an integral part of S~estimation algorithms for linear regression. Subsamples are required to be nonsingular. Usually, discarding a singular subsample and drawing a new one leads to a sufficient number of nonsingular subsamples with a reasonable computational effort. However, this procedure can require so many subsamples that it becomes infeasible, especially if levels of categorical variables have low frequency. A subsampling algorithm called nonsingular subsampling is presented, which generates only nonsingular subsamples. When no singular subsamples occur, nonsingular subsampling is as fast as the simple algorithm, and if singular subsamples do occur, it maintains the same computational order. The algorithm works consistently, unless the full design matrix is singular. The method is based on a modified LU decomposition algorithm that combines sample generation with solving the least squares problem. The algorithm may also be useful for ordinary bootstrapping. Since the method allows for S~estimation in designs with factors and interactions between factors and continuous regressors, we study properties of the resulting estimators, both in the sense of their dependence on the randomness of the sampling and of their statistical performance.},
